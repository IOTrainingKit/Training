# 📘 Introduction to the Input-Output Analysis Training Kit

Welcome to the **Input-Output Analysis Training Kit** — a structured, hands-on course designed to introduce key concepts and techniques in input-output (IO) modeling. Whether you're new to the topic or looking to sharpen your skills, this training package provides guided exercises, real-world data, and five core models to help you explore and apply IO methods effectively.

## 🎯 Objective

This training kit aims to provide learners with a **clear, step-by-step understanding** of input-output analysis using real economic and environmental data. We walk through the construction of various models — from basic national IO tables to more advanced multi-regional environmental extensions — combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation.

## 📊 Data Sources

The course uses publicly available, high-quality datasets:

- **WIOD National Input-Output Tables**

 These datasets provide a robust foundation for exploring intersectoral linkages, trade flows, and environmental impacts across economies.

## 🛠️ Software Requirements

To complete the exercises and models, you will need:

- [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/) – Statistical programming language
  
- [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) – User-friendly IDE for R

- [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) – Advanced programming language 
  
- **Excel** – Used for initial data exploration and visualization

All scripts and data preparation files are written in R and provided in this repository.
